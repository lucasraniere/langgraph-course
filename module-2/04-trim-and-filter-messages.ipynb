They're often seen swimming alongside boats and are known to use echolocation.\\n\\n2. **Porpoises**: Similar to dolphins but generally smaller and with different teeth. They tend to be less acrobatic than dolphins.\\n\\n3. **Manatees**: Also known as sea cows, manatees are gentle herbivores found in warm coastal waters and rivers. They have a slow metabolism and can be seen grazing on sea vegetation.\\n\\n4. **Sea Lions**: These pinnipeds are known for their barking vocalizations and playful nature. They are social animals, often seen in large groups on beaches or rocky shores.\\n\\n5. **Walruses**: Recognizable by their long tusks and whiskers, walruses are large marine mammals that primarily feed on benthic invertebrates.\\n\\n6. **Seals**: There are various types of seals, including harbor seals and elephant seals. They are typically more agile in the water than on land.\\n\\n7. **Narwhals**: Known for their long, spiral tusk, narwhals are unique to Arctic waters. The tusk is actually an elongated tooth and is thought to have sensory and social functions.\\n\\n8. **Orcas (Killer Whales)**: These highly intelligent and social apex predators belong to the dolphin family and are known for their complex social structures and hunting techniques.\\n\\n9. **Sperm Whales**: The largest toothed whales, sperm whales are known for their deep diving capabilities in search of squid and other prey.\\n\\n10. **Beluga Whales**: These small white whales are highly vocal and are known for their distinctive calls. They thrive in cold Arctic and sub-Arctic waters.\\n\\nEach of these mammals has unique adaptations and behaviors that make them fascinating to study.
